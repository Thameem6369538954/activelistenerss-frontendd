            Active Listeners offers three subscription plans: Basic, Pro, and

          <h2>2. Subscription Renewal</h2>
          <p>
            Subscriptions to our Basic, Pro, and Premium plans are automatically
            renewed at the end of the subscription period unless cancelled.

          <h2>3. Cancellation Policy</h2>
          <p>
            If you wish to cancel your subscription and prevent future charges,
            you must do so before the renewal date. You can cancel your
            subscription by accessing your account settings or contacting our
            customer support team.

          <h2>4. Refund Policy</h2>
          <p>
            a. Cancellation During Subscription Period: If you cancel your
            subscription during the subscription period, you will continue to
            have access to the services until the end of the current billing
            cycle. We do not offer refunds for partial subscription periods.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. Multiple Transactions: In the event of multiple transactions
            occurring due to technical errors or user oversight, we will
            investigate the issue promptly. If it is determined that multiple
            transactions were made erroneously, we will issue a refund for the
            additional charges.

            If you are eligible for a refund, the refund will be processed to
            the original payment method used for the transaction. Please allow
            up to 7 business days for the refund to reflect in your account
